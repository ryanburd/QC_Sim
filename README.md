# Quantum Computer Simulator

This repository is for a quantum computer simulator that can run basic quantum circuits.
NOTE: This version is under maintenance to reformat the class structure such that the bits will be treated as class objects for storing the gates applied to each bit.

## Current status
The user can:
- Create qubits
- Create classical bits
- Apply Pauli-X, -Y, -Z, Hadamard, phase, and pi/8 single qubit gates
- Apply Controlled-X, -Y, -Z, SWAP two qubit gates
- Apply Toffoli three qubit gate
- Keep track of all gates applied, to which qubits, and in what order
- Measure a qubit and store the result in a classical bit

## Notes
This is a personal project of ryanburd.
