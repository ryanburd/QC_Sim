# Quantum Computer Simulator

This repository is for a quantum computer simulator that can run basic quantum circuits.

## Current status
The user can:
- Create qubits
- Create classical bits
- Apply Pauli-X, -Y, -Z single qubit gates
- Apply Hadamard single qubit gate
- Keep track of all gates applied, to which qubits, and in what order

## Notes
This is a personal project of ryanburd.
