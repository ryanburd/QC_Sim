# Quantum Computer Simulator

This repository is for a quantum computer simulator that can run basic quantum circuits. This version can only consider pure states since state vectors are used for all calculations. Future updates will use density operators so that mixed states can be considered as well.

## Current status
The user can:
- Create qubits
- Create classical bits
- Apply Pauli-X, -Y, -Z, Hadamard, phase, and pi/8 single qubit gates
- Apply Controlled-X, -Y, -Z, SWAP two qubit gates
- Apply Toffoli three qubit gate
- Keep track of all gates applied, to which qubits, and in what order
- Measure a qubit and store the result in a classical bit

## Notes
This is a personal project of ryanburd.
